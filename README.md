JSMENU
======

Just a simple jquery menu include to static / simple landing pages

This is a simple jQuery plugin to include menu across different pages.

This is meant for Landing Zones and small websites.

Instead of Creating menu in different pages and updating it when ever a new page is added; add data in the menu_data.js file and Tada!!!! (not that exiciting..) the menu will get added in all pages...


Please feel free to include it in your page and provide suggestions to improve / fork it as you like.

contact me at denil@mi5.com..... yeap.. I just made that up.
